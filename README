This code implements the Shan and Chen (1993) model for a 3D, periodic domain.

Cartesian domain decomposition is used to divide the work load among several MPI ranks.

Output is written to files using XDMF/HDF5 format and can be visualized using ParaView.

A python script is used to combine data from different MPI ranks and time steps in one meta-file (light data).
